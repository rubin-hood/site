    <h2>Hello, I'm Andreas - IT enthusiast, problem solver, and tech whisperer.</h2>
    <p>
    While others talk to their computer, I listen to it and tell you what it really means!
    </p>
    <p>
    When others see 'Error 404', I see an exciting challenge!
    </p>
    <p>
    I transform computer language into human language, so that you too can understand what your computer is up to all day!
    </p>
    <p>
    Professionally, I have worked in various technical fields. In doing so, I have repeatedly found that access to technical knowledge is often unnecessarily complicated. This is exactly what I want to change with this website.
    </p>
    <p>
    With Rubin-Hood, I pursue the goal of making IT knowledge understandable and accessible so that everyone - whether beginner or professional - can benefit from it. I share my experiences, offer useful tips, and implement creative projects that show that technology can be not only complex but also exciting and accessible.
    </p>
    <p>
    In my free time, I like to experiment with new technologies, develop my skills further, and am always looking for new challenges that help me and others progress.
    </p>
    <p>
    I look forward to sharing this journey with you and am excited to see where it takes us!
